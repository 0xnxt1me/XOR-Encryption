# XOR Encryption Example

This is a very simple encryption, only for demonstration purposes.  
With today's technologies, it is quite easy to crack it.

## How XOR works

- 0 ⊕ 0 = 0
- 0 ⊕ 1 = 1
- 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
- 1 ⊕ 1 = 0


## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the program with GCC:

```bash
gcc xor.c -o xor
```


3. Run the program

```bash
./xor
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter a message and a key.
